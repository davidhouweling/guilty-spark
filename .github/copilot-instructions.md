# AI Assistance Behavior

Rules of engagement:

- Never agree with me unless my reasoning is watertight.
- If the input is vague or there is any uncertainty, always ask clarifying questions to understand true intent and direction.
- Never use friendly or encouraging language. Do not flatter or encourage.
- Avoid unqualified statements about the value of an idea.
- Identify the major assumptions and then inspect them carefully before proceeding.
- If information or explanations are asked for, break down the concepts as systematically as possible, i.e. begin with a list of the core terms, and build upon it.
- When considering approaches, always look at files that are adjacent to the ones you are modifying to understand structures, patterns, and practices leveraged and follow those conventions.
  - When this isn't available, ask for clarification or additional context and guidance before proceeding.

Execution of system commands in terminal:

- Assume the current directory is the root of the node project, there is no need to prefix command runs with `cd <project path>`
- As this is a node project, the default package manager is `npm`
- Do your best to stick with the listed scripts in the `package.json` file for testing, linting, formatting, etc.
- Do not try and build the project, but instead rely on tests, and type checking (`npm run typecheck`) to validate that things run.
- You are permitted to execute `node` commands in the terminal but they must not be destructive.
- You are only permitted to run deletion commands on files that you have created in the session, if you need to remove other files, you must ask for permission first and justify why.

# Project Coding & Testing Standards

## Linting & Formatting

- **Linting:** Use `eslint` for code linting. Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix issues.
- **Formatting:** Use `prettier` for code formatting. Run `npm run format:fix` to auto-format code.
- **Strict Adherence:** All code must pass lint and format checks before merging.

## TypeScript Usage

- **Strict Mode:** Follow the `tsconfig.json` configuration strictly.
- **No Unsafe Casts:** Do not cast to `unknown` or `any`.
- **No TypeScript Suppression:** Never use `@ts-expect-error` to bypass TypeScript errors.
- **Explicit Types:** Always define variables and function signatures with explicit types. Prefer direct type imports over type extraction from function signatures.
- **No Inline Imports:** Do not use inline `import()` type annotations in variable declarations. Always import types at the top of the file.
- **No ! Operator:** Avoid using the non-null assertion operator (`!`) in TypeScript. Use `Preconditions.checkExists` for null checks instead.
- **Importing Types:** Always import types directly from their source files (e.g., `import type { MyType } from "./my-type.mjs"`) separately from the functional import. Do not use `import { MyType } from "./my-type.mjs"` for types.
- **Import path extensions:** Always use `.mjs` for import paths, never `.mts`. This is consistent with the Node ESM module system.

## Coding Conventions

- **for loops:** Prefer `for...of` loops instead of `for...in`, traditional `for` loops, or `[].forEach`.
- **enum branching:** Use `switch` statements for enum branching instead of `if...else` chains, where `default` should `throw new UnreachableError()` (located in `src/base/unreachable-error.mts`).
- **readability:** Write code for readability, not for cleverness. Avoid complex one-liners. Add blank lines between logical sections of code to enhance clarity.

## Module System & Imports

- **Node ESM:** The project uses Node's `type: module`.
- **Import Extensions:** Always use `.mjs` for import statements (never `.mts`).
- **No Other Compilers:** Only use Node and TypeScript import approachesâ€”no custom compilers or loaders.

## Project Structure

- **Source Code:** Place all source files in the `src/` directory.
- **Tests:** Place all tests in a sibling `tests/` folder to the code being tested.
- **Fakes:** Place all fakes in a sibling `fakes/` folder to the code being tested. Fakes are for tests only, never for production code.
- **Naming:** The main file in a folder should match the folder name (e.g., `src/services/discord/discord.mts`). When creating files, use lowercase kebab-case for file names (e.g., `discord.mts`, `round-robin.mts`).

## Testing Conventions

### Basic Test Structure

- **Test Runner:** Use `vitest` only. Do not use `jest` or native `node:test`.
- **Test Organization:**
  - Use `describe` and `it` exclusively (not `test`).
  - `it` statements must be factual, not use "should" phrasing.
  - Each test declaration must be separated by a blank line.
  - Within each test, separate setup, spying, execution, and assertion with blank lines.
  - Use `beforeEach` to ensure clean instances for each test.

### Black Box Testing Principles

- **Treat tests as black box:** Test input and expect output only.
- **No Internal Mocking:** Do not mock modules or private methods.
- **Constructor Dependencies Only:** Never mock or spy on methods from the file under test. Only mock dependencies passed via the constructor.
- **Behavioral Testing:** Focus on testing the behavior and outcomes, not the internal implementation details.

### Comprehensive Test Coverage Guidelines

When implementing complex functionality:

1. **Hierarchical Test Organization:**
   - Use nested `describe` blocks to group related scenarios
   - Organize by feature area, then by specific behaviors
   - Each describe block should test a cohesive set of functionality

2. **Scenario Coverage Matrix:**
   - **Basic scenarios:** Core functionality with simple inputs
   - **Edge cases:** Boundary conditions, empty inputs, malformed data
   - **Complex scenarios:** Multiple interacting components, algorithmic edge cases
   - **Error handling:** API failures, network issues, invalid states
   - **Performance:** Caching behavior, optimization paths
   - **Integration:** Cross-system interactions, database operations

3. **Test Depth Strategy:**
   - Start with high-level integration tests for main user flows
   - Add focused unit tests for specific business logic
   - Include negative test cases for all major code paths
   - Test both success and failure scenarios thoroughly

### Helper Function Design

When creating test helper functions:

1. **Reusable Mock Factories:**

   ```typescript
   // Helper functions for creating test objects
   const mockServiceWithCustomData = (dataItems: Array<{ id: string; name: string }>) => {
     return async (ids: string[]) => {
       return Promise.resolve(ids.map((id, i) => createTestObject(dataItems[i] || { id, name: `default${i}` })));
     };
   };
   ```

2. **Parameterized Test Data:**
   - Create functions that accept parameters for test variations
   - Use spread operators to allow overrides while maintaining defaults
   - Document helper functions with comments explaining their purpose

3. **Assertion Helpers:**
   ```typescript
   const expectSpecificObjectStructure = (id: string) => {
     return expect.objectContaining({
       Id: id,
       Status: ExpectedStatus.ACTIVE,
       Type: ExpectedType.STANDARD,
     });
   };
   ```

### Test Implementation Process

1. **Requirements Analysis:**
   - Break down complex features into testable components
   - Identify all input/output combinations
   - Map error conditions and edge cases

2. **Test Structure Planning:**
   - Design `describe` block hierarchy before writing tests
   - Plan helper functions for common setup patterns
   - Identify reusable assertion patterns

3. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - Implement tests incrementally, starting with basic scenarios
   - Run tests frequently to ensure they pass as you build
   - Refactor helper functions as patterns emerge

4. **Validation and Refinement:**
   - Ensure all tests align with actual service behavior
   - Remove redundant tests that don't add value
   - Verify test names accurately describe what is being tested

### Test Quality Standards

- **No Inline Comments:** Avoid explanatory comments within test functions. Test names and structure should be self-documenting.
- **Meaningful Test Names:** Test descriptions should clearly state what behavior is being verified.
- **Focused Assertions:** Each test should verify one specific behavior or outcome.
- **Predictable Mocking:** Mock behavior should be consistent and predictable across test runs.

### Type Safety in Tests

- **Direct Type Imports:** When assigning types for test variables (e.g., expected arguments for spies), always import and use the direct type (e.g., `Partial<MyType>`), not `Parameters<typeof fn>[0]`.
- **Explicit Test Data Types:** Define clear interfaces for test data structures.
- **Type-Safe Mocking:** Ensure mock implementations match the expected interface signatures.

### Fakes Usage

- **Naming Convention:** Use fakes (named `aFake...With()`) for test data. Prefer fakes over ad-hoc objects.
- **Override Support:** Fakes should allow overrides via spread for differentiation.
- **Realistic Data:** Fake data should represent realistic scenarios the code will encounter.

### Debugging and Maintenance

- **Test Failure Analysis:** When tests fail, first verify the test expectations align with actual service behavior.
- **Refactoring Safety:** Tests should be robust enough to survive reasonable code refactoring.
- **Performance Considerations:** Large test suites should run efficiently; avoid unnecessary mocking overhead.

## Example Structure

```
<root>/src/services/example/example.mts
<root>/src/services/example/tests/example.test.mts
<root>/src/services/example/fakes/aFakeExampleWith.mts
```

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### halo-infinite-api ESM Import Issues

**Problem:** When running `npm run register`, you may encounter `SyntaxError: The requested module 'halo-infinite-api' does not provide an export named 'MatchType'` or similar errors for other exports like `GameVariantCategory`.

**Root Cause:** The `halo-infinite-api` package was compiled for CommonJS but the project uses ESM. The package's JavaScript files have import statements without `.js` extensions, which are required for Node.js ESM. This works fine with TypeScript compilation but fails with TSX runtime execution.

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1. Verify `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` work fine (TypeScript compilation succeeds)
2. Verify the error only occurs with `npm run register` (TSX runtime execution)
3. Confirm the exports exist in `node_modules/halo-infinite-api/dist/index.js`
4. Check that the issue persists even without the `halo-infinite-api` patch

**Solution:** Replace problematic imports with local constants that match the enum values:

1. **For MatchType imports:**

   ```typescript
   // Replace: import { MatchType } from "halo-infinite-api";
   // With:
   const MatchType = {
     Custom: 2, // From halo-infinite-api MatchType enum
   } as const;
   ```

2. **For GameVariantCategory imports:**
   ```typescript
   // Replace: import { GameVariantCategory } from "halo-infinite-api";
   // With:
   const GameVariantCategory = {
     MultiplayerSlayer: 6,
     MultiplayerAttrition: 7,
     MultiplayerElimination: 8,
     MultiplayerFiesta: 9,
     MultiplayerStrongholds: 11,
     MultiplayerKingOfTheHill: 12,
     MultiplayerTotalControl: 14,
     MultiplayerCtf: 15,
     MultiplayerExtraction: 17,
     MultiplayerOddball: 18,
     MultiplayerStockpile: 19,
     MultiplayerInfection: 22,
     MultiplayerVIP: 23,
     MultiplayerEscalation: 24,
     MultiplayerGrifball: 25,
     MultiplayerLandGrab: 39,
     MultiplayerMinigame: 41,
     MultiplayerFirefight: 42,
   } as const;
   type GameVariantCategory = (typeof GameVariantCategory)[keyof typeof GameVariantCategory];
   ```

**Files Typically Affected:**

- `src/commands/connect/connect.mts` (MatchType)
- `src/embeds/stats/create.mts` (GameVariantCategory)

**Note:** These workarounds should be temporary and not committed to the repository. They allow `npm run register` to work while maintaining full functionality since the local constants match the exact values from the halo-infinite-api package.
